This is a fork with a Jenkins File that I created to build and push a maven project as an image to AWS

## Details

The jenkinsfile is in the /JenkinsDevWindows/ branch, and last worked best on a local Jenkins server in Windows 10.
On an EC2 instance running Jenkins, the build process consumed all of the server's resources for more than an hour without completing.
